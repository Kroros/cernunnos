                AVON is a non-barred spiral galaxy approximately 67000 light years in radius. It posseses 2 major spiral arms. I have dubbed these
                the Stag Arm and the Bull Arm.
                The vessel has detected organic matter near
                [█████,█████,███] prompting me to head there immediately. 
                Should these scans be a false positive, I will leave AVON and continue my explorations. But in the case that 
                there is actual life in this galaxy, I will stay and document everything I can learn about it.`}
